# moth

A reimplementation of [jamespy](https://github.com/jamesbt365/jamespy), a spy/utility bot, now in rust using [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) and [lumi](https://github.com/moth-rs/lumi).

This bot is purpose built and has stuff that is hardcoded, I'd highly recommend you don't use this.

There are no setup instructions (yet), but the nightly toolchain is required.
